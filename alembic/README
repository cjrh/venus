To create a new migration:

1. In the venus root, run the following:

    $ alembic revision -m "a basic description of the migration"

   This will create a new migration file, e.g.

        "alembic/versions/ee6e4fb62b2e_restructure_pseudowire_schema.py"

2. Now you go edit the file. The "upgrade" section is for the upgrade
   step, and the "downgrade" function is, unsurprisingly, for a downgrade.
